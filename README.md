- Hosted project link available from the repository metadata

## Tech stack

JavaScript, Vite, React

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Replace the placeholders with this repository's clone URL and local directory.

## Available commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the local development workflow. |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build. |
| `npm run lint` | Run static-analysis and lint checks. |

## Configuration

No repository-specific configuration file is required for the basic workflow documented above.

## Project structure

```text
src/  # primary application source
public/  # static files served as-is
```

## Repository status

This repository is maintained as a project reference and portfolio artifact.

## Development

Before submitting a change, run `npm run lint`, `npm run build`.
Keep changes focused, avoid committing generated artifacts unless the project already tracks them, and update this README whenever setup or behavior changes.

## Security and configuration hygiene

Keep secrets in local environment variables or an ignored `.env` file. Never commit API keys, access tokens, private keys, production database URLs, or customer data. If a credential is committed, revoke and rotate it; deleting the file in a later commit does not remove it from Git history.

## Contributing

Open an issue or provide context before making a large change. Prefer small pull requests with a clear purpose, verification notes, and screenshots for visible UI changes.

## Additional project notes

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
